# UniFrame

## What is this?
I honestly don't know right now.

The general idea is that the application has as of right now two different built in "modules". (Audio & Video)
These will allow you to control, combine, and reroute Audio and Video to different sources.

The main goal for the Audio module is to allow for the easy creation of different audio sources, then being able to route application audio and physical audio devices into said sources to use as one source to pipe into things like Discord, OBS, etc.

For Video however I don't have a direct goal with that.
The plan is to have it be almost exactly like the Audio module but for Video. (Although that seems like it would be a bit too much like OBS)

However, these are called modules so I am slowly working to add modding support so custom Modules and Themes can be added to the application.

The default modules are most likely going to change so keep a look out!

## Can I build this myself?
Yes you can indeed build it yourself!

(**Note: You will need NodeJS and Yarn to build this project**) https://nodejs.org, https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install

1. First go ahead and clone the repository to your machine:
`git clone https://github.com/TheModdedChicken/UniFrame.git`

(If you forked this before you cloned make sure to change the clone link to your forked repository)


2. Next cd the local repo and install its dependencies:

`cd "C:\the\sacred\repo\location\on\your\PC\UniFrame"`

`npm i`

3. After the dependencies are installed you can run `npm start` to launch the application.
